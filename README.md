# Number-Theory-Python-programs
Here is a small collection of Python Programs to do Number Theory Algorithms.
Included are:
1. Find the Greatest Comon Divisor
2. Find the Least Common Multiple
3. Find a prime Factorization
4. Find a Congruence/reduce (mod n)
5. The Euclidean Algorithm
6. Solve a Linear Diophantine Equation
7. Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all Prime numbers less than or equal to n
I put this collection together for a Number Theory class. If you'd like to comment or add to this collection, Please e-mail me at peterkw@verizon.net
